Metabase is an open source tool to query your company data without writing SQL
queries.

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Metabase instance on Scalingo in
under 5 minutes.

## Metabase Deployment

We published a repository
[metabase-scalingo](https://github.com/Scalingo/metabase-scalingo) on GitHub to
help you deploy Metabase on Scalingo. Deploying a Metabase instance is now at a
click range:

## Deployment by Cloning the Repository

You first need to create an application on Scalingo. Let's say its name is
`my-app`.

Then, clone our repository and add the Scalingo git remote:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Scalingo/metabase-scalingo
$ cd metabase-scalingo
$ git remote add scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-app.git
```

We now need to slightly configure the Scalingo application. First, this
application needs to use the [multi-buildpacks]({% post_url
platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}). Add the `BUILDPACK_URL`
environment variable:

```bash
$ scalingo --app my-name env-set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/Scalingo/multi-buildpack.git
```

You also need to add a PostgreSQL addon to your application. A "Starter 512"
plan would be enough.

Last, deploy your application with:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

## Update the Metabase instance

Metabase ships regularly new versions. In order to update, go to the application's dashboard, in the “Code” tab, and click “Deploy” on the master branch as the screenshot shows:

You can also use the CLI and run:

```bash
scalingo app --my-name integration-link-manual-deploy master
```
